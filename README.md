## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Some of the biggest things I learned were

- 1 | The Impact of max-width on width. If max-width is defined. Then a static width can't go over that value.
- 2 | The uses for psudo elements such as `::before` or `::after` which can be used to change properties in a certain way.
- 3 | Finally I learned the psudo class of `:nth-child()` which can be very useful, instead of needing multiple classes/Id's
